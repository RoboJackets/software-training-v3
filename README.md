# Software Training - Fall 2024

Welcome to the Software Training Github Repository for the RoboJackets. This repostory contains all the code written that is covered during our in-person software training sessions. Feel free to clone this repo and navigate it as you see fit!

The main goal for Software Training this year is to ensure you're prepared to maximize the contributions you can make to your respective software team. As such, we begin with a deep dive into C++, followed by learning the fundamentals of important robotics concepts and algorithms.
